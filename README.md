# ccs-integration-method
Interactive method visualization for integrating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies into consumer product development. Developed as part of a Master’s thesis in Mechanical Engineering at TU Darmstadt and Linköping University.

# CCS Integration Method

This repository contains an interactive visualization tool for illustrating the systematic integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies into consumer goods development.

The project is part of the Master’s thesis:
**"Development of a method for the integration of CCS approaches in consumer goods"**  
conducted at TU Darmstadt in cooperation with Linköping University.

## Objective

To support product developers in evaluating the feasibility of integrating CCS solutions into new products — even without deep CCS-specific knowledge.

## Technologies

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- SVG-based UML visualization
- Dynamic SVG switching
- Context-specific side panel for method details

## Structure

## How to use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ccs-integration-method.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or deploy via GitHub Pages).
3. Hover and click on highlighted areas in the diagram to explore CCS-related development phases.

## Example Use Case

The method is validated using an air purifier scenario — determining CCS compatibility, evaluating CO₂ neutrality, and selecting appropriate CCS technologies.
