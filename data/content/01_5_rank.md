**Objective:**  
Prioritize all remaining CCS technology options based on predefined, weighted evaluation criteria.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase supports decision-making by scoring all viable technologies using a structured evaluation matrix. It includes:
- Definition and grouping of evaluation criteria across technical, operational, and financial aspects  
- Weighting of criteria to allow product-specific prioritization  
- Transparent ranking of CCS technologies

These steps enable developers to narrow down technology options based on structured performance and integration trade-offs.

**Extended Method Activities:**  
Criteria are grouped into four domains: CCS Performance, Integration & Infrastructure, Service & Maintenance, and Financial Impact.<br>
The matrix tool enables direct integration of previous evaluation results and facilitates objective ranking based on product-specific weighting.<br>
The result is a ranked list of suitable technologies.

**Outcome:**  
- Transparent and weighted ranking of remaining CCS options  
- Foundation for final selection step
