**Objective:**  
Select the most suitable CCS technology from the ranked list and update product requirements accordingly.

**Scope and Activities:**  
Based on the previous ranking, one CCS solution is selected for further integration. It includes:
- Review of the highest-ranked technologies  
- Final decision based on ranking results and contextual fit  
- Transfer of CCS-specific constraints into the main requirement list

These steps ensure that the selected technology is fully reflected in the updated product requirement list.

**Extended Method Activities:**  
The final selection concludes the CCS Selection Process and acts as a formal interface to downstream development phases.<br>
The selected technology's characteristics are documented and translated into product requirements.<br>
These updates enable targeted solution development in the next phase.

**Outcome:**  
- Final selected CCS technology  
- Updated product requirement list including CCS constraints
