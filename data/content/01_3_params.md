**Objective:**  
Provide standardized performance data for selected CCS technologies as input for neutrality evaluation.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase focuses on researching and preparing CCS-specific parameters for further assessment. It includes:
- Identification of concrete technology variants within each selected category  
- Extraction of key parameters such as CO₂ fixation rate and CO₂ capacity
- Harmonization and unit conversion to enable consistent evaluation

These steps ensure that all relevant CCS options are described through a common, comparable parameter set.

**Extended Method Activities:**  
To enable structured, data-based evaluation, this phase compiles functional performance indicators from literature for each technology.<br>
Reported values are normalized to a uniform unit system to ensure comparability across technologies.<br>
The result forms one of the three key evaluation dimensions alongside the product-specific PCF and integration constraints.

**Outcome:**  
- Structured dataset of CCS parameters in standardized units  
- Quantitative foundation for neutrality assessment
