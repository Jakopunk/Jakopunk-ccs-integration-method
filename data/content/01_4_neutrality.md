**Objective:**  
Assess whether the selected CCS technologies are capable of achieving carbon neutrality over the product’s lifetime.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase performs a quantitative comparison between required and actual CCS performance. It includes:
- Calculation of the minimum fixation rate (Rₘᵢₙ) based on PCF and product lifetime  
- Determination of the necessary CCS unit size to meet Rₘᵢₙ  
- Comparison of the required unit with product-specific constraints

These steps ensure that only those CCS technologies are selected that can realistically meet neutrality targets within integration limits.

**Extended Method Activities:**  
A performance threshold (Rₘᵢₙ = PCF/lifetime) is introduced to define the lower bound for CO₂ removal.<br>
Each CCS solution is scaled virtually to meet this threshold, and the resulting unit is compared to product constraints such as volume, serviceability, or safety.<br>
If the integration is technically feasible, the technology is forwarded to the ranking step. Otherwise, it is excluded from further consideration.

**Outcome:**  
- Filtered list of CCS technologies meeting the neutrality condition  
- Quantified integration requirement per CCS solution
