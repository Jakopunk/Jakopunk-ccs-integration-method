**Objective:**  
Filter out infeasible CCS technology categories based on general product characteristics before entering detailed evaluation.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase enables a two-stage exclusion process to eliminate unsuitable CCS options early. It includes:
- A general feasibility check (e.g. volume, constant usage, environmental compatibility)
- A technology-specific filter based on product characteristics

These steps allow engineers to quickly identify whether CCS integration is fundamentally possible and which technology classes are worth considering.

**Extended Method Activities:**<br> 
The decision logic is structured to guide developers without requiring deep CCS knowledge.  
The process builds on the classification of CCS technologies into combustion-based, biological, and chemical/physical systems.  
Decision points such as “Is constant humidity maintainable?” or “Are there strict safety requirements?” are used to sequentially exclude incompatible options.  
This ensures low entry barriers and a robust match between product context and technology type.

**Outcome:**  
- Filtered list of viable CCS technology categories  
- Early termination if CCS integration is fundamentally not feasible
