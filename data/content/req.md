**Objective:**  
Defines the fundamental product requirements for the subsequent product development process.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase initiates the development process by formulating both general and CCS-specific requirements. It includes:
- Structured identification of product-related boundary conditions and development objectives
- Implementation of the CCS selection process to enable data-driven decision-making

**Extended Method Activities:**<br>
The integrated CCS selection process provides a methodical, data-driven framework for identifying suitable CCS technologies.  
The level of detail increases progressively to reduce the entry barrier for developers.  
Throughout the process, PCF data, CCS technology profiles, and product requirement data are systematically used as evaluation inputs.

**Outcome:**  
- Structured requirement list, including CCS-specific integration requirements
