**Objective:**  
Quantify the product’s carbon footprint as a reference value for evaluating the required performance of CCS technologies.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase determines the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) either by using an existing value or by calculating it based on iso standards.
These steps ensure a quantitative foundation for assessing whether a CCS technology can realistically achieve CO₂ neutrality over the product’s lifetime.
 
**Extended Method Activities:**  
The PCF defines the required performance threshold and represents one of the three core evaluation parameters in the CCS selection process.

**Outcome:**  
- PCF value as numerical baseline for technology screening
