**Objective:**  
Systematically explore, evaluate, and select technical solution principles to fulfil requirement-related product functions.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This phase translates the productâ€™s functional architecture into concrete technical concepts. It includes:
- Definition of core functions and their structural interrelations  
- Identification and structuring of solution principles to fulfil these functions  
- Evaluation and selection of the most promising solution concept

These steps build a bridge between the abstract functional level and detailed design, and are essential for robust and manufacturable product concepts.

**Extended Method Activities:**  
To accommodate the architectural impact of CCS integration, this phase was extended by a dedicated step: *Assess CCS Integration Approaches*.<br>
This step ensures that suitable strategies for embedding the selected CCS technology are evaluated before detailed solution development begins.<br>
The integration strategy constrains the solution space and aligns system architecture with CCS-specific needs such as additional volume, control interfaces, and subsystem interaction.

**Outcome:**  
- Structured function model  
- CCS integration strategy  
- Identified and evaluated solution concepts
