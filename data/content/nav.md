**Objective:**  
Introduce the core purpose of the CCS integration method: enabling products to achieve lifecycle COâ‚‚ neutrality by systematically integrating carbon capture technologies during product development.

**Scope and Activities:**  
This overview presents the method's structure, based on the VDI 2221 and W-Model frameworks. It follows a phase-based logic and includes:
- Requirement Phase
- Solution Exploration
- Development
- Product Integration

<span style="color: green;">Green-marked</span> areas indicate steps adapted specifically for <span style="color: green;">CCS integration</span>, while blue areas represent unchanged, standard development phases.  
The diagram serves as a navigation element and visualises the individual phases. **Click** on the **highlighted areas** to call up more detailed information on the individual phases.
